# Review and Look Ahead

Congratulations on completing 40 days of Nautobot challenges! It is time to take a breather and pad yourself on the back for a job well done (no punt intended)! 

Starting from Day 41, we will be diving deeper into developing Nautobot applications. 

Today's challenge is all about taking a breather, review what we have learned and looking ahead to the next 20 days of Nautobot App challenges. 

## What We have Learned

It is hard to believe how far we have come. Let's review: 

- We learned about how to set up the development environment in Day 1. 
- We put together a 'Hello World` job with user input and logging in Days 3 and 4. 
- We learned about Django ORM and how to use Object as variables in Days 5 to 6. 
- We convert Python scripts to Nautobot Jobs in Days 9 - 11. 
- We learned about Job Button, Job Hooks, Job API, Scheduling, and Approvals in the following days 12 - 17. 
- We learned about using Git as data source for Jobs code. 
- We learned about how to process upload files in Days 21 - 22. 
- Job templates, testing, secrets, troubleshooting, Ansible integration were introduced in Days 23 - 33.
- We took on a monster job creation for the next 6 days in creating a job to design future sites.  

If any of these concepts were unclear, now is a great time to go back and review. 

## Looking Ahead

While Nautobot Jobs is great at enhancing the capabilities of the Nautobot platform, they have their limitations. 

Nautobot Jobs are Python scripts that perform specific tasks within Nautobot, such as data manipulation, integration, and reporting. They are easy to write and quick to deploy. 

However, when we need a more comprehensive and sophisticated extension, Nautobot Apps is the way to go. They offer custom user interfaces, custom models, and more advanced automation. 

Here are a few more advantages of Apps: 

- Flexibility: Apps provide a higher level of customization and flexibility. 
- Scalability: Apps are designed to more scalable for larger-scale tasks. 
- Reusable Components: Apps can include reusable components, such as custom fields, views, and templates. 

## From Jobs to Apps

You have built a great foundation in the last 40 days mastering Nautobot Jobs. Now we will transition to building Nautobot Apps based on the knowledge. 

Looking ahead, Apps enable network developers to create more impactful and comprehensive solutions. You can even share your Apps to the rest of the Nautobot community. 

I can't wait to get started! What about you? 

## Day 40 To Do

Go ahead and post what you are most excited about making a transition from Jobs to Apps on a social media of your choice, make sure you use the tag `#100DaysOfNautobot` `#JobsToBeDone` and tag `@networktocode`, so we can share your progress! 

In tomorrow's challenge, we will "bake a cookie for Nautobot App". Sounds interesting, right? See you tomorrow!
