## Why Nautobot? 

Because [Nautobot](https://docs.nautobot.com/) is an extensible and flexible Network Source of Truth and Network Automation platform that is the cornerstone of any network automation architecture. Even if you are not using Nautobot currently, it is worth the time and energy to leverage Network to Code's experience in helping hundreds of companies achieve their network automation goals. 

## No really, why should I join? 

Ok, now that you asked, let's expand the reasons on the methodology and approach of this challenge. 

### You will learn how to learn

In our combined tens of years of training network automation professionals, we know learning in itself is a skill that needs to be practiced. Breaking down big projects into smaller tasks, learn a new subject progressively, and having the small wins to keep the learner motivated are all key areas that help us learn. We hope this project can prepare the learners on the skills of learning. 

### You will improve your discipline

As we all know, it takes discipline to complete a difficult task. Discipline in learning refers to consistent self-control in setting up time to study, setting a clear goal each sitting, making a structured effort toward learning, all of which we hope to help you practice in this challenge. 

### You will become a self-starter

This is a self-directed learning path, you are a self-starter simply by starting this challenge. 

### You will create a strong portfolio

We hope by the end of the challenge, you will have enough skills and small projects to show off your skills as a network automation engineer. 

### You will join a vibrant community 

Learning is more fun when we can bounce off ideas with each other, pick others up when they are down, and collaborate in the process. You will join other like-minded people during this learning process.

## Tips to Help you Thrive in the Challenge

As you plan your 100 Days of Nautobot challenge, we can offer some tips. 

### Plan ahead 

The most important thing is to plan ahead. We prefer consistency over spikes in effort and time. Plan to set aside roughly an hour each day to work on the task. 

### Keep a journal 

There are multiple advantages of keeping a learning journal. It helps to track the progress, encourages reflection, and enhance the memory. If you follow the suggestion of publish your results on social media, that is a form of a learning journal. 

### Make a public commitment

Making a public commitment increases social accountability and provide network opportunities. In other words, it keeps you going. Make sure you use the tag of #100DaysOfNautobot when posting so we can all share your success.
