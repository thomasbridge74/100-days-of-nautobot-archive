# Python Script to Job - Part 1 Netmiko `show command` Python script

In today's challenge, we will apply what we learned about Nautobot Jobs to network lab devices.  

In many of the future challenges, we will need to have a network lab our Nautobot instance can interface with. Part of our objective for today's challenge is to set up a lab environment within Codespace using [Containerlab](https://containerlab.dev/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have enough Codespace credit or do not mind paying the fee to have a better experience, you should launch the Codespace instance with more core. How much more? I would start with `4-core`. 

![codespace_machine_types](images/codespace_machine_types.png)

As we stated in the `important` section above, if we add more containers to the Codespace environment, we may find high CPU usage during the launch. I have successfully completed the lab with the `2-core` machine type, but it did take some time before the CPU usage normalized.

## Lab Environment Setup

The Nautobot portion of the lab environment setup will be the same as [Lab Setup Scenario 1](../Lab_Setup/scenario_1_setup/README.md). Below is a summary of the steps. Consult the guide for a detailed background, if needed. 

> [!TIP]
> If you have stopped the Codespace environment and restart again but found the Docker daemon has stopped working, please follow the steps in the setup guide to rebuild the environment.

Here is a review of the steps to start Nautobot: 

```
$ cd nautobot-docker-compose/
$ poetry shell
$ invoke build
$ invoke db-import
$ invoke debug
```

Let's set up the network lab. 

## Containerlab

[Containerlab](https://containerlab.dev/) is a way to build a virtual lab using network operating system with containers. 

As part of our setup, the Containerlab executables have already been installed. We can run the `version` command as a way to test if the installation was successful:

```
@ericchou1 âžœ ~ $ containerlab version
  ____ ___  _   _ _____  _    ___ _   _ _____ ____  _       _     
 / ___/ _ \| \ | |_   _|/ \  |_ _| \ | | ____|  _ \| | __ _| |__  
| |  | | | |  \| | | | / _ \  | ||  \| |  _| | |_) | |/ _` | '_ \ 
| |__| |_| | |\  | | |/ ___ \ | || |\  | |___|  _ <| | (_| | |_) |
 \____\___/|_| \_| |_/_/   \_\___|_| \_|_____|_| \_\_|\__,_|_.__/ 

    version: 0.57.3
     commit: 8c357f5a
       date: 2024-09-21T12:26:37Z
     source: https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab
 rel. notes: https://containerlab.dev/rn/0.57/#0573
 ```

In the next step, we will download the Arista cEOS image to be used in our lab. 

## Arista cEOS

[Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/en/) provides a free download of their containerized EOS system that can be used with Containerlab. The registration is free, but you will need to use a business email address. 

Once registered, you can download the image via "Support -> Software Download": 

![arista_1](images/arista_1.png)

> [!TIP]
> Please also see [Lab Setup Scenario 1](../Lab_Setup/scenario_1_setup/README.md) for instructions on how to download Arista cEOS image

Pick one of the "cEOS Lab" software image, in the screenshot, we show ```cEOS64-lab-4-32.0F.tar.xz```: 

![arista_2](images/arista_2.png)

Once the software image is downloaded, right-click on the Explorer area and choose to upload the image: 

![arista_3](images/arista_3.png)
 

Depending on your internet speed, the upload time might take a few minutes. Once the image is uploaded, use the following command to import the image to Docker: 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to substitute the version number that matches the version you downloaded.

> [!WARNING]
> In the example below, the file was already unzipped, it does not have the `.xz` file extension. Please include the extension, if necessary. 

```
docker import cEOS64-lab-4.32.0F.tar ceos:4.32.0F
```

Now we are ready to launch our lab!

## Launching Containerlab

We have prepared a ```clab``` directory under the ```100-days-of-nautobot``` directory containing the lab topology and startup configurations: 

```
@ericchou1 âžœ ~/100-days-of-nautobot-challenge (main) $ cd clab/
@ericchou1 âžœ ~/100-days-of-nautobot-challenge/clab (main) $ ls
ceos-lab.clab.yml  startup-configs
```

For this initial test, we can comment out the `NYC` devices and only launch the `BOS` devices to save time and resources. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the same image name that was used in the previous step if different than what was used in this document!

```yaml
---
name: "ceos-lab"
prefix: ""

mgmt:
  network: "bridge"

topology:
  kinds:
    ceos:
      image: "ceos:4.32.0F"

  nodes:
    bos-acc-01:
      kind: "ceos"
      startup-config: "startup-configs/bos-acc-01.conf"

    bos-rtr-01:
      kind: "ceos"
      startup-config: "startup-configs/bos-rtr-01.conf"

    # nyc-acc-01:
    #   kind: "ceos"
    #   startup-config: "startup-configs/nyc-acc-01.conf"

    # nyc-rtr-01:
    #   kind: "ceos"
    #   startup-config: "startup-configs/nyc-rtr-01.conf"

  links:
    - endpoints: ["bos-acc-01:eth1", "bos-rtr-01:eth1"]
    # - endpoints: ["bos-acc-01:eth2", "nyc-rtr-01:eth2"]
    # - endpoints: ["bos-rtr-01:eth2", "nyc-acc-01:eth2"]
    # - endpoints: ["nyc-acc-01:eth1", "nyc-rtr-01:eth1"]
```

> [!TIP]
> As an alternative, we can also use the `--node-filter` command during launch: 
> 
> ```
> $ cd clab/
> $ sudo containerlab deploy --topo ceos-lab.clab.yml --node-filter bos-acc-01,bos-rtr-01
> ```

Let's go ahead and launch the lab: 

```
@ericchou1 âžœ ~/100-days-of-nautobot-challenge/clab (main) $ sudo containerlab deploy --topo ceos-lab.clab.yml

```

Take note of the IP addresses shown; in the next step, we will use a simple Netmiko script to perform ```show``` commands.

## Netmiko Python Script

Nautobot leverages the multivendor, open-source [Netmiko](https://pynet.twb-tech.com/blog/netmiko-python-library.html) library created by Kirk Byers to interact with network devices. As such, it is already included in our Nautobot instance.

Let's go ahead and try out ```netmiko``` on the Nautobot container using ```nbshell```:

```
$ cd nautobot-docker-compose/
$ poetry shell
$ invoke nbshell
```

We can follow the simple example illustrated on the [Netmiko Getting Started](https://pynet.twb-tech.com/blog/netmiko-python-library.html) section: 

```
>>> from netmiko import ConnectHandler
>>> net_connect = ConnectHandler( 
...     device_type="arista_eos", 
...     host="172.17.0.2", 
...     username="admin", 
...     password="admin", 
... )

>>> net_connect
<netmiko.arista.arista.AristaSSH object at 0x7abfa8bbf610>

>>> net_connect.find_prompt()
'ceos-01>'
```

Fantastic! We can communicate with the device. Let's grab the ```show version``` output from the device: 

```
>>> output = net_connect.send_command("show version")
>>> print(output)
Arista cEOSLab

```

I will leave it to you to repeat the same step for the other device ```172.17.0.3``` to test the lab reachability. 

After you are done with today's work, shutdown Containerlab using the ```destroy``` command: 

```
$ cd clab/
$ sudo containerlab destroy --topo ceos-lab.clab.yml 
```

## Day 9 To Do

Remember to stop the codespace instance on [https://github.com/codespaces/](https://github.com/codespaces/). 

Go ahead and post the output of the Netmiko show command on a social media of your choice, make sure you use the tag `#100DaysOfNautobot` `#JobsToBeDone` and tag `@networktocode`, so we can share your progress! 

In tomorrow's challenge, we integrate this script into our Nautobot Job. See you tomorrow!
