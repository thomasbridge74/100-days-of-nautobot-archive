# App Review and Looking Ahead

Congratulations on making it to Day 60! 

We will take a breather today, review what we have learned, and go back to the days that might not be clear the first time around. 

Starting in Day 61, we will dive deeper to different technical areas of Django and Nautobot. 

## Day 41 - 59 Review

It is hard to imagine we were simply installing and uninstalling Nautobot app in Day 41, and by Day 59, we were working with functional Nautobot apps. 

Let's review what we have done: 

- Day 41: Install and uninstall Nautobot Apps on PyPI. 
- Days 42 - 43: Use Nautobot Cookiecutter to scaffold Nautobot app development and learn about the file structure. 
- Days 44 - 45: We built an attributable app package and install it on another instance. 
- Days 46 - 49: We moved away from Nautobot for a minute and build a Django app, from creating a database model, to building views, templates, and finally adding an input form.
- Days 50 - 59: We use the Nautobot repo's example_app to build a new feature to learn the interaction between database models, URL dispatch, views, and templates. 

If any of the days still seem unclear at this point, today would be a great day to review and gain clarity. 

## Looking Ahead to Day 61 - 80

Starting in Day 61, the next segment is about spending more time on the main components of Nautobot apps. For example, we will spend several days on database models, several more days on Django / Nautobot views, etc. 

## Day 60 To Do

If you started a codespace instance for review, remember to stop the codespace instance on [https://github.com/codespaces/](https://github.com/codespaces/). 

Go ahead and post on a social media of your choice some feedback for Days 41 - 60, what do you enjoy the most? What can we do better? Make sure you use the tag `#100DaysOfNautobot` `#JobsToBeDone` and tag `@networktocode`, so we can share your progress! 

We can't wait to see you in the next segment!
